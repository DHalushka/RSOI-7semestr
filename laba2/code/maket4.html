                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>
                    After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King Christian IV,
                    a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the 
                    king's honour. The old site east of the Aker river was not abandoned however and 
                    the village of Oslo remained as a suburb outside the city gates. The suburb 
                    called Oslo was eventually included in the city proper. In 1925 the name of the 
                    suburb was transferred to the whole city, while the suburb was renamed "Gamlebyen", 
                    literally "the Old town", to avoid confusion.The Old Town is an area 
                    within the administrative district Gamle Oslo. The previous names are reflected in 
                    street names like Oslo gate (Oslo street) and Oslo hospital.

                <h2>Prehistory</h2>
                <p>
                    Oslo was destroyed several times by fire, and after the fourteenth calamity, 
                    in 1624, Christian IV of Denmark and Norway ordered it rebuilt at a new site 
                    across the bay, near Akershus Castle and given the name Christiania. Long 
                    before this, Christiania had started to establish its stature as a centre 
                    of commerce and culture in Norway. The part of the city built starting 
                    in 1624 is now often called Kvadraturen because of its orthogonal 
                    layout in regular, square blocks.Anatomigården is a historic timber 
                    framing house located on the north side of Christiania Torv.

                    The last Black Death outbreak in Oslo occurred in 1654. In 1814 
                    Christiania once more became a real capital when the union with 
                    Denmark was dissolved.
